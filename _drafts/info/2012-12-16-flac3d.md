I've actually wanted to do an embryogenesis GIF for months, but I couldn't quite figure out how to make it work. Then I stumbled across <a href="http://imgur.com/0MNXclx" target="_blank">this awesome GIF </a> on Reddit and got the idea to use a spiraling animation style. (Incidentally, if anyone knows who made that GIF I'd love to know).
