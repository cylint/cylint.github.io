Jake is straight class. From vinyl to tea and bow ties to grammar, he’s got it all. Jake is looked up to in his involvement across campus not only because of his leadership insights but also because he’s 6’6″ and most people have to physically ‘look up’ at him. He’s respectful and has a charming personality even though his puns often get old pretty quick. Jake is a top notch gentleman, and we are proud to have him as our president.
