To commemorate the beauty of this garden, the founderhad written an essay on the birth and the attractions of the garden.

But the heavyburden of the upkeep of the garden forced rebuilt it into the West Garden tothe City God Temple. Since then, the private garden has been accessible to thepublic. For a while in history, the structures in the garden had served as officesfor over a score of trade guilds.
