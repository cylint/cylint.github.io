I am pleased that managing your academic career has been so capably and carefully translated into chinese and will therefor readily be available to chinese readers. The book was originally written primarily with a British experience. However, I think that much of the material contained in the book is of interest to a wider audience, not least in China.

China has made great economic strides in recent years and the Chinese government has been paying considerable attention to science and technology and the further development of the countryâ€™s intellectual capacity. In this task much progress has also been made, but a number of challenges remain. An awareness of international experience, and its adaptation to Chinese circumstances, may help in this task.

The academic environment in china is not always as strong as it could be and, despite the growing reputation of chinese universities, areas of inefficiency remain in academic organization. An academic regulatory framework is not always present and there is sometimes a lack of intellectual integrity in areas such as plagiarism. Overcoming these deficiencies would help Chinese scholars to write pieces of work that have a considerable international impact.
I hope that readers in China enjoy this book and find it helpful to them in the development of their own careers.
