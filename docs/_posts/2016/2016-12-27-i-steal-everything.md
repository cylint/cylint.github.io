<span class="post__tag">tough life</span>

------

i know! I steal everything.

You backed the wrong horse. I got nothing.

Pierce, you're musical. You're creative.

You can do this. I believe in you.

Well, you shouldn't. I quit.

You listen up, Pierce!

I'm gonna tell you what my mother told me when i wanted to quit cheerleading.

you're not very pretty, you have no boobs, and you can't do a basket toss to save your life,

but you made a commitment.

so pick up your pompoms, Pierce. Stuff your bra, and get ready for the team bus to forget you at a taco bell, because life is tough.

but we soldier on, and that's just the way it goes.

The way it goes.
