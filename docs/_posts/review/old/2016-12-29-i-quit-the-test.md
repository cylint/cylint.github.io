CPTA published the exam results this afternoon, haves and have-nots.
Because of negative emotions, I quit the test.I missed the test of structure engineer this year.
There are several reasons,
One, I’m not ready for the test.
Two, the exam is arranged in Wenzhou and Taizhou, because of G20.
Three, I lost the courage, and didn’t burn my boat behind me.
Four, I set too much goals at this period.

In the next year, I determined,
I’m not willing to buy housesat present, I can’t bear the financial stress.
Another advantage to waiting,
In the future,I might have a girlfriend, consider her workplace, will make a better decision.

### First step: I decide to leave Shanghai, back to Wanzhou.

I love construction new bridges, tunnels, highways, but I don’t fit such job right now, I’m just a editor, working this way is not only exhausting, but I think it makes me less competent.
In fact, I’m really lack of imagination, and continued losing interest in anything. I’m not sure what to do now. Nothing I do makes any difference anyway, so why don’t I leave?

I know I’ll lost a lot, intermediate grade, some welfare in Shanghai, 
job promotion opportunities, etc. 
But this will bring me several moths to plan my future. I can continue work, or to even study in university, this is my choice.
At the same time, I can study with my younger sister, she needs to improve her grades.

### Second step: I want to Study in Wuhan.


Zhejiang University is ranked as one of the top universities in China, and is also very beautiful. 
Even I’m very close to ZJU, I’m still not one of here.
<!-- But the government let people out of the city, the school checked every person’s id during the G20 summit. -->

Chongqing University is my alma mater, the best in Chongqing, So I should choose a university out of CQ. Wanhan is a good choice. Wuhan has great number of universities, Wuhan University, HUST…

### Third step:find a major that I enjoy.

Two day left before year 2017.
