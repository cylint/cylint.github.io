Build the JavaHelp System

The easiest way to build the JavaHelp system is to open the three NetBeans projects that make up the JavaHelp system sources in the NetBeans IDE. You can also build it using the Ant build script (build.xml) located in the project's javahelp_nbproject/ directory. Note that the build downloads the JSP and Servlet APIs that are required for compilation (JDIC is stubbed out).

The project also has GNU Make makefiles that can build the project on the Solaris operating system. In order to use the makefiles, you must download and install the Glassfish build and set the J2EEHOME environment variable to its top-level directory. The makefiles are adaptable to the Linux operating system.

The primary method for building the project is using GNU Make, the Ant scripts are provided solely for your convenience. The demos included with the release can only be built using the makefiles and are not built during the Ant build.
