People's Square is located a few blocks west of the Bund, Marking the west end of the Pedestrain Mall, East Nanjing Road. In the heat of Shanghai, the square is the center of public life in the city.
The area of the square set its first step for the center of the city in the 1860s when the British colonists had a large racecourse built on once of the fields of the loacls. For about a century, the racecourse had been a sports arena attracting crowds of gamblers. There were so many people traveling between the Bund and the racecourse that a road called Park Lane was constructed which was renamed Nanjing Road later. Around the course some accommodation and entertainment facilities were provided, including Park Hotel, Great World Entertainment Center, and Club Building of the Race Course Association .Gradually this area became a partt of the city proper. In the early 1950s, the racecourse was closed when gambling was declared illegal by the new government, and it was turned into People's Park and People's Square. In the 1990s, people's Square underwent a massive reconstruction when much of the pople space was tunned into landscaped area and a few imposing structures were erected.
